"""
Peri-event analysis functions for neurospatial.

This module provides functions for aligning neural data to events:
- align_spikes_to_events: Get per-trial spike times relative to events
- peri_event_histogram: Compute peri-event time histogram (PSTH)
- population_peri_event_histogram: Compute PSTH for multiple units
- align_events: Align events to reference events

# Implementations will be added in Milestone 6
