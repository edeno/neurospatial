Based on PLAN.md and CLAUDE.md, make TASKS.md. This will:

1. Breaks down high-level goals into manageable tasks (use checkboxes)
2. Organizes work into clear milestones
3. Makes subtasks actionable and direct for Claude Code to follow
4. Uses best planning practices (clear success criteria, dependencies noted)
